List of Python Projects 

## [Project 1 - Rock, Paper, Scissor](https://github.com/vermaparul85/Python-Projects/tree/main/Rock-Paper-Scissor)
* This is a simple game for beginners using randomization.
* This game allows you to play with computer.
* You choose one number from 0, 1, 2 for Rock, Paper and Scissor respectively.
* Computer also chooses one number and displays who has won the game.

## [Project 2 - Guessing Game](https://github.com/vermaparul85/Python-Projects/tree/main/Guessing-Game)
* This program picks a random integer from 1 to 100, and has players guess the number.
* The rules are:
1. If a player's guess is less than 1 or greater than 100, say "OUT OF BOUNDS"
2. On a player's first turn, if their guess is
   <br> within 10 of the number, return "WARM!"
   <br> farther than 10 away from the number, return "COLD!"
3. On all subsequent turns, if a guess is 
   <br> closer to the number than the previous guess return "WARMER!"
   <br> farther from the number than the previous guess, return "COLDER!"
4. When the player's guess equals the number, it tells the player they've guessed correctly *and* how many guesses it took!

## [Project 3 - Carnival Game](https://github.com/vermaparul85/Python-Projects/tree/main/Guessing-Game)
* This program depicts the carnival game of guessing which cup has the Red Ball

## [Project 4 - Hangman](https://github.com/vermaparul85/Python-Projects/tree/main/Hangman)
* This project asks you to guess the word.
* you have 6 lives to guess the correct word.
* If you fail to guess the word and exhaused all lives, you will die.

## [Project 5 - Tic-Tac-Toe Game](https://github.com/vermaparul85/Python-Projects/tree/main/Tic-Tac-Toe)
* This is a two player game.

## [Project 6 - Playing Card War Game](https://github.com/vermaparul85/Python-Projects/tree/main/Playing-Cards-Games)
* Two players will each start off with half the deck.
* Then they each remove a card, compare which card has the highest value.
* The player with the higher card wins both cards. 
* The game continues until one players is out of cards.
* If both player draw same card, then they will draw 5 more cards. Whoever has the top card with higher value will win all the drawn cards.

## [Project 7 - Playing Card Blackjack Game](https://github.com/vermaparul85/Python-Projects/tree/main/Playing-Cards-Games)
To play a hand of Blackjack the following steps must be followed:
* Create a deck of 52 cards
* Shuffle the deck
* Ask the Player for their bet
* Make sure that the Player's bet does not exceed their available chips
* Deal two cards to the Dealer and two cards to the Player
* Show only one of the Dealer's cards, the other remains hidden
* Show both of the Player's cards
* Ask the Player if they wish to Hit, and take another card
* If the Player's hand doesn't Bust (go over 21), ask if they'd like to Hit again.
* If a Player Stands, play the Dealer's hand. The dealer will always Hit until the Dealer's value meets or exceeds 17
* Determine the winner and adjust the Player's chips accordingly
* Ask the Player if they'd like to play again

### Method 1
Play Blackjack game using functions and loops only.

### Method 2
Play Blackjack game using OOP concepts and functions/loops.

## [Project 8 - Password Generator](https://github.com/vermaparul85/Python-Projects/tree/main/Password-Generator)
* The program will ask:
  <br>How many letters would you like in your password?
  <br>How many symbols would you like?
  <br>How many numbers would you like?

* The objective is to take the inputs from the user to these questions and then generate a random password.

## [Project 9 - Caesar-Cipher](https://github.com/vermaparul85/Python-Projects/tree/main/Caesar-Cipher)
* The objective of this program is to encrypt and decrypt the messages.

## [Project 10 - Calculator Program](https://github.com/vermaparul85/Python-Projects/tree/main/Calculator)
* Program asks the user to type the first number.
* Program asks the user to type a mathematical operator (a choice of "+", "-", "*" or "/")
* Program asks the user to type the second number.
* Program works out the result based on the chosen mathematical operator.
* Program asks if the user wants to continue working with the previous result.
* If yes, program loops to use the previous result as the first number and then repeats the calculation process.
* If no, program asks the user for the fist number again and wipes all memory of previous calculations.

### Method 1
Method 1 is creating a calculator program using simple function and loops.

### Method 2
Method 2 is creating a calculator program using functions as variable and recursion call.
