List of Python Prjects 

## [Project 1 - Rock, Paper, Scissor](https://github.com/vermaparul85/Python-Projects/tree/main/Beginners-Projects/Rock-Paper-Scissor)
* This is a simple game for beginners using randomization.
* This game allows you to play with computer.
* You choose one number from 0, 1, 2 for Rock, Paper and Scissor respectively.
* Computer also chooses one number and displays who has won the game.

## [Project 2 - Guessing Game](https://github.com/vermaparul85/Python-Projects/tree/main/Beginners-Projects/Guessing-Game)
* This program picks a random integer from 1 to 100, and has players guess the number.
* The rules are:
1. If a player's guess is less than 1 or greater than 100, say "OUT OF BOUNDS"
2. On a player's first turn, if their guess is
   <br> within 10 of the number, return "WARM!"
   <br> farther than 10 away from the number, return "COLD!"
3. On all subsequent turns, if a guess is 
   <br> closer to the number than the previous guess return "WARMER!"
   <br> farther from the number than the previous guess, return "COLDER!"
4. When the player's guess equals the number, it tells the player they've guessed correctly *and* how many guesses it took!
